# This is Gene Pool

Witness the effects of Darwinian evolution as hundreds of simulated organisms
compete for mates and food. Explore this virtual aquarium of proto-swimming
robots ('swimbots'), and see how mate preference can affect the course of
evolution.

Watch the emergence of a dominant race of swimmers in about 30 minutes. Keep it
running for longer and swimming skills will improve, where swimming 'skill' is
determined entirely by natural selection.

Every time you start a new pool, the outcome will be different.
