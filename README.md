2. DESCRIPTION

Witness the effects of Darwinian evolution as hundreds of simulated 
organisms compete for mates and food. Explore this virtual aquarium 
of proto-swimming robots ('swimbots'), and see how mate preference 
can affect the course of evolution.

Watch the emergence of a dominant race of swimmers in about 30 
minutes. Keep it running for longer and swimming skills will 
improve, where swimming 'skill' is determined entirely by natural 
selection.

Every time you start a new pool, the outcome will be different.
